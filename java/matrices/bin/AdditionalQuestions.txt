1.Why are the add, multiply, and zero methods defined abstract in the GenericMatrix class?
	
The add, multiply, and zero methods are defined abstract in the GenericMatrix class
because the formatting for the elements within a matrix regarding the IntegerMatrix class 
is different from the formatting for the RationalMatrix class. Since the GenericMatrix 
class is an abstract class, then the methods can be implemented in the subclasses that have 
the matrix element type specificed.

2.How are the add, multiply, and zero methods implemented in the IntegerMatrix class?
	
The add method is implemented by simply adding the two elements together. The 
multiply method is implemented by simply multiplying the two elements. Finally, the zero 
method is implemented by just returning 0.

3.How are the add, multiply, and zero methods implemented in the RationalMatrix class?
	
The add and multiply methods are implemented by calling the add and multiply 
methods in the Rational class, in which the calculations are done. Finally, the zero 
method is implemented by returning a new Rational().
