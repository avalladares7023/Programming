Use a nested for-loop or a nested while-loop to calculate the following pattern.
The first number(n) is the outer loop index and the second number(m) is the inner loop index 

n * m

1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3

2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6

3 * 1 = 1
3 * 2 = 2
3 * 3 = 3

...

9 * 1 = 1
...
9 * 9 = 81
